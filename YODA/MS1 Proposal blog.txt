# Project Description
Matrix multiplication is a computationally complex process that lies at the center of many numerical algorthims.
The aim of this project is to implement a digital accelerator for the task of matrix multiplication.
The accelerator should accept two appropriate rectangular matrices from a computer, calculate the product, and return the resulting matrix to the computer.

# Proposed Solution
The accelerator will be implemented on a Nexys A7 FPGA board. As an intial prototype, the matrices will be programmed onto and stored in the FPGA's BRAM, but time permitting, the system may be adapted to store the matrices in the onboard DDR3 RAM and accept data from the computer via UART over USB. The matrix multiplication algorithm should be as parallelized as possible in order to achieve maximum execution speed. Optionally, the accelerator could give some indication of progress using the onboard LEDs or 7-segment displays.

# Prototype Specification
- Matrices will be programmed into and stored on the FPGAs BRAM.
- Matrices will contain 16-bit integer elements.
- (optional) Matrices will be stored on the onboard DDR3 RAM, and stored/retrieved over UART over USB.
- The result matrix will be transferred back to the PC via UART over USB.
- (optional) The accelerator will provide progress indication using either the onboard LEDs or the 7-segment displays.

# Criteria for acceptable solution
- Starts up
- Correctly multiplies matrices
- Transfers the resulting matrix back to the PC via UART over USB

# Criteria for ideal solution (optional)
- Stores matrices in onboard DDR3 RAM
- Receives matrices from PC via UART over USB
- Displays some indication of progress via the onboard LEDs or 7-segment displays.

# Potential issues and constraints
- Time dedicated to the project needs to be spit correctly between the mamn tasks that this project encompasses, like development, parallelisation and acceleration.
- The lockdown will mean that our project will have to be developed modularly, as we have 3 developers who are unable to co-develop in person. This will inform a lot of our design decisions.
