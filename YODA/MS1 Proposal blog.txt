Project Description
The purpose of this project is to design and implement a digital accelerator capable of performing matrix multiplication. 
The accelerator must be capable of accepting and working with floats, as well as using square matrices, though accomodation for rectangular matrices should be made. 
A start and end bit must be provided, by raising outputs high.

Proposed Solution
Using an FPGA, the code should run primarily in parallel, to ensure max speedup over a conventional sequential processor. 
The system will take in two memory addresses and will correctly multiply the matrices out and save it to a third memory address.
After multiplication is complete, a output should be pulled high.

Prototype Specification
-FPGA will be used
-A standard PC CPU will be used as a benchmark/golden measure
-On board memory will be used to store data
-Data will be printed to a external/onboard display to verify multiplication was correct
-User input will be provided from an external device.
-Completion notification will be provided by both onboard display and LED being pulled high
-Computation must be at least 4 times faster than the sequential solution provided by golden measure

Criteria for acceotable solution
-Starts up
-Takes user input
-Computes data sets
-Provides an output to screen
-Notifies with LED that computation is complete
